This'll prevent\n        endless validation in internal methods. These tests are\n        structured with an item for every option available. An\n        option can be marked as required by setting the 'r' flag.\n        The testing function is provided with three arguments:\n            - The provided value for the option;\n            - A reference to the options object;\n            - The name for the option;\n    \n        The testing function returns false when an error is detected,\n        or true when everything is OK. It can also modify the option\n        object, to make sure all values can be correctly looped elsewhere. */\n    //region Defaults\n    var defaultFormatter = {\n        to: function (value) {\n            return value !== undefined && value.toFixed(2);\n        },\n        from: Number\n    };\n    var cssClasses = {\n        target: \"target\",\n        base: \"base\",\n        origin: \"origin\",\n        handle: \"handle\",\n        handleLower: \"handle-lower\",\n        handleUpper: \"handle-upper\",\n        touchArea: \"touch-area\",\n        horizontal: \"horizontal\",\n        vertical: \"vertical\",\n        background: \"background\",\n        connect: \"connect\",\n        connects: \"connects\",\n        ltr: \"ltr\",\n        rtl: \"rtl\",\n        textDirectionLtr: \"txt-dir-ltr\",\n        textDirectionRtl: \"txt-dir-rtl\",\n        draggable: \"draggable\",\n        drag: \"state-drag\",\n        tap: \"state-tap\",\n        active: \"active\",\n        tooltip: \"tooltip\",\n        pips: \"pips\",\n        pipsHorizontal: \"pips-horizontal\",\n        pipsVertical: \"pips-vertical\",\n        marker: \"marker\",\n        markerHorizontal: \"marker-horizontal\",\n        markerVertical: \"marker-vertical\",\n        markerNormal: \"marker-normal\",\n        markerLarge: \"marker-large\",\n        markerSub: \"marker-sub\",\n        value: \"value\",\n        valueHorizontal: \"value-horizontal\",\n        valueVertical: \"value-vertical\",\n        valueNormal: \"value-normal\",\n        valueLarge: \"value-large\",\n        valueSub: \"value-sub\"\n    };\n    // Namespaces of internal event listeners\n    var INTERNAL_EVENT_NS = {\n        tooltips: \".__tooltips\",\n        aria: \".__aria\"\n    };\n    //endregion\n    function validateFormat(entry) {\n        // Any object with a to and from method is supported.\n        if (isValidFormatter(entry)) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        throw new Error(\"noUiSlider (\" + VERSION + \"): 'format' requires 'to' and 'from' methods.\");\n    }\n    function testStep(parsed, entry) {\n        if (!isNumeric(entry)) {\n            throw new Error(\"noUiSlider (\" + VERSION + \"): 'step' is not numeric.\");\n        }\n        // The step option can still be used to set stepping\n        // for linear sliders.
